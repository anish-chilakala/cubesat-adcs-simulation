CubeSat ADCS simulation and control research project

# CubeSat Attitude Determination and Control System

## Overview
This project investigates the modeling, simulation, and control of a CubeSat-class spacecraft's attitude under sensor noise and external disturbances.

## Objectives
- Model rotational dynamics of a CubeSat
- Design and evaluate PID-based attitude control
- Analyze control performance under realistic disturbances

## Tools
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- MATLAB (Control System Toolbox)
- LaTeX (Overleaf)

## Status
Foundations phase: coordinate frames, quaternions, and rotational dynamics.
